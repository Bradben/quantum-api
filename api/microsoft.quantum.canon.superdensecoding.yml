   Superdense coding transfers 2 classical bits by encoding them into 1 qubit, using 1 EPR pair ("2c=1q+1e").
remarks: " The circuit first creates an EPR pair between two ancilla qubits. Depending on the value of two classical \n bits then one out of 4 possible Bell states is created by applying a local transformation to just one half of the\n EPR pair. Finally, a Bell measurement is applied to decode the two bits of classical information from the state.\n [ Nielsen & Chuang, CUP 2000, Section 2.3, http://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511976667 ]"
