  a: >2-

     A Boolean value that represent the first of two input bits to the superdense coding protocol.
  b: >2

     A Boolean value that represent the second of two input bits to the superdense coding protocol.
output: {}
summary: >2

   Superdense coding transfers 2 classical bits by encoding them into 1 qubit, using 1 EPR pair ("2c=1q+1e").
remarks: "\n The circuit first creates an EPR pair between two ancilla qubits. Depending on the value of two classical \n bits then one out of 4 possible Bell states is created by applying a local transformation to just one half of the\n EPR pair. Finally, a Bell measurement is applied to decode the two bits of classical information from the state.\n [ Nielsen & Chuang, CUP 2000, Section 2.3, http://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511976667 ]"
