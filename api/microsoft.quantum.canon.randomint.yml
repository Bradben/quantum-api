type: operation
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Canon
input:
  maxInt: >2

     An integer one larger than the largest integer to be
     returned by this operation.
output: {}
summary: >2

   Generates a random number uniformly sampled in the interval
   $[0, \texttt{maxInt})$.
remarks: >2-

   This operation uses postselection of an integer drawn from
   a uniform distribution whose maximum is a power of two,
   and thus may not make a constant number of calls to the
   underlying source of random classical bits.
syntax: >2-

  operation .RandomInt (maxInt : Int) : Int
