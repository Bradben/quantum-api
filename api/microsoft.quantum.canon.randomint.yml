name: RandomInt
type: operation
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Canon
summary: >2
   Generates a random number uniformly sampled in the interval
   $[0, \texttt{maxInt})$.
remarks: >2-
   This operation uses postselection of an integer drawn from
   a uniform distribution whose maximum is a power of two,
   and thus may not make a constant number of calls to the
   underlying source of random classical bits.
syntax: 'operation RandomInt (maxInt : Int) : Int'
input:
  content: '(maxInt : Int)'
  types:
  - name: maxInt
    summary: >2
       An integer one larger than the largest integer to be
       returned by this operation.
