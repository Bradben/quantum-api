type: operation
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Canon
input:
  oracle: >2-

     An operation representing a unitary $U$ such that $U(t)\ket{\phi} = e^{i t \phi}\ket{\phi}$
     for a known eigenstate $\ket{\phi}$ and an unknown phase $\phi \in \mathbb{R}^+$.
  eigenstate: >2-

     A register in the state $\ket{\phi}$.
  initialMean: >2-

     Mean of the initial normal prior distribution over $\phi$.
  initialStdDev: >2-

     Standard deviation of the initial normal prior distribution over $\phi$.
  nMeasurements: >2-

     Number of measurements to be accepted into the final posterior estimate.
  maxMeasurements: >2-

     Total number of measurements than can be taken before the operation is considered to have failed.
  unwind: >2-

     Number of results to forget when consistency checks fail.
output: {}
summary: >2

   Performs iterative phase estimation using a random walk to approximate
   Bayesian inference on the classical measurement results from a given
   oracle and eigenstate.
