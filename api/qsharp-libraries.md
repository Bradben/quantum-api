# Q# libraries

The Q# standard library includes operations, functions and user-defined types used to develop quantum programs. Three additional libraries built on top of the standard library are also included - the chemistry, numerics, and machine learning libraries.

For more information, see the [Q# libraries overview](xref:microsoft.quantum.libraries.overview).
