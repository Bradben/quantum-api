name: Modulus
type: function
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Canon
summary: Computes canonical residue of `value` modulo `modulus`.
remarks: >-
  This function behaves the way a mathematician would expect Mod function to behave,
  as opposed to how operator `%` is behaving in C# and Q#.
syntax: 'function Modulus (value : Int, modulus : Int) : Int'
input:
  content: '(value : Int, modulus : Int)'
