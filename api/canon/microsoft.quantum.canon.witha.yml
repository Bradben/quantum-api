summary: " Given operations implementing operators $U$ and $V$, performs the\n operation $UVU^{\\dagger}$ on a target. That is, this operation\n conjugates $V$ with $U$. \n The modifier 'A' indicates that the inner operation is adjointable.\n"
remarks: >2
   The outer operation is always assumed to be adjointable, but does not
   need to be controllable in order for the combined operation to be
   controllable.
