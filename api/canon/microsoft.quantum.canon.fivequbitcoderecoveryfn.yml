summary: " Returns function that maps error syndrome measurements to the \n appropriate error-correcting Pauli operators by table lookup for\n the ⟦5, 1, 3⟧ quantum code.\n"
remarks: " By iterating over all errors of weight $1$, we obtain a total of $3*5=15$ possible non-trivial syndromes. \n Together with the identity, a table of error and corresponding syndrom is built up. For the 5 qubit code  \n this table is given by: $X\\_1: (0,0,0,1); X\\_2: (1,0,0,0); X\\_3: (1,1,0,0); X\\_4: (0,1,1,0); X\\_5: (0,0,1,1), \n Z\\_1: (1,0,1,0); Z\\_2: (0,1,0,1); Z\\_3: (0,0,1,0); Z\\_4: (1,0,0,1); Z\\_5: (0,1,0,0)$ with $Y_i$ obtained by adding the $X_i$ and $Z_i$ syndromes. Note that the \n ordering in the table lookup recovery is given by converting the bitvectors to integers (using little endian).\n"
