   Given operations implementing operators $U$ and $V$, performs the
   operation $UVU^{\dagger}$ on a target. That is, this operation
   conjugates $V$ with $U$.
remarks: >2
   The outer operation is always assumed to be adjointable, but does not
   need to be controllable in order for the combined operation to be
   controllable.
