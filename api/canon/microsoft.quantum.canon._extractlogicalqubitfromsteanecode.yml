summary: >2
   Syndrome measurement and the inverse of embedding.
   $X$- and $Z$-stabilizers are not treated equally,
   which is due to the particular choice of the encoding circuit.
   This asymmetry leads to a different syndrome extraction routine.
   One could measure the syndrome by measuring multi-qubit Pauli operator
   directly on the code state, but for the distillation purpose
   the logical qubit is returned into a single qubit,
   in course of which the syndrome measurements can be done without further ancillas.
remarks: " > [!WARNING]\n > This routine is tailored \n > to a particular encoding circuit for Steane's 7 qubit code;\n > if the encoding circuit is modified then the syndrome outcome\n > might have to be interpreted differently."

       The logical qubit and a pair of integers for $X$-syndrome and $Z$-syndrome.
       They represent the index of the code qubit on which a single $X$- or $Z$-error
       would have caused the measured syndrome.
