   Given an operation with two inputs, applies Curry's isomorphism
   $f(x, y) \equiv f(x)(y)$ to return an operation of one input which
   returns an operation of one input.
remarks: " The following are equivalent:\n ```qsharp\n op(x, y);\n \n let curried = CurryOp(op);\n let partial = curried(x);\n partial(y);\n ```"
syntax: "function CurryOp (op : (('T, 'U) => ())) : ('T -> ('U => ()))"
input:
  content: "(op : (('T, 'U) => ()))"

       An operation which accepts the first element of a pair and returns
       an operation which accepts as its input the second element of the
       original operation's input.
