summary: >2
   Given 15 approximate copies of a magic state, yields
   one higher-quality copy.
remarks: >2
   We follow the algorithm of Knill.
   However, the present implementation is far from being optimal,
   as it uses too many qubits.
   The magic states are injected in this routine,
   in which case there are better protocols.

    summary: >2
       A register of fifteen qubits containing approximate copies
       of a magic state. Following application of this distillation
       procedure, ``roughMagic[0]` will contain one higher-quality
       copy.
